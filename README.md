# Database Management Systems
### Learning Database Management and Systems.

## Lab 1:
### Description:
- This lab is about saving our data in a .txt file for storage purpose, like a very raw database. Then we perform file I/O to read from and write to the .txt files.
- Firstly, we store 20 random integers in a text file and then read them and print them on the terminal.
- Secondly, we store student details in the form: roll number, name and age in a .txt file. Then, we read from this file and print the content read on the terminal.
- Thus, it is a very basic database which we are trying to create.
### How to run the programs:
- Navigate to the Session 1 folder.
    ```bash
    cd "Session 1"
    ```
- Start WSL.
    ```bash
    wsl
    ```
- Run the command:
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
- Then run the command:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
- Now, to create and write into a .txt file:
    ```bash
    make write_a
    ```
- To read from the created .txt file.
    ```bash
    make read_a
    ```
- Similarly:
    ```bash
    make write_c
    ```
- Now to read:
    ```bash
    make read_c
    ```
